</head>

<body>
    <h3>In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A
        cup is
        an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way,
        JavaScript
        objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.</h3>

    <h6>Example:</h6>
    <h4>
        Like here in my Example I can choose a person to declare as an Object. <br>
        Object should be within Curly Braces{}. Properties seperated with Comma(,)
        <pre>
            var objectName = {name:'James', email:'james@gmail.com', designation:'developer', age:32, mob:12345};
        </pre>
    </h4>

    <script>
        var person = { name: 'Matrix', age: 32, gender: 'Male', email: 'matrix@gmail.com', height: 5.11, color: 'fair' };

        person.mobile = 12345; // This method is called as 'DOT NOTATION'. We are able to call property this way also.
        person['designation'] = 'Web Developer'; // This method is called as 'SQUARE NOTATION'. Within Suqare Brackets we can call properties.

        // typeof() is a Builtin keyword to identify Data Type from an Object
        console.log(typeof (person.email)); // Output will show email as a 'string'.

        console.log(person); // Output will show as an 'Object'

    </script>

    <h1>Accessing Objects Better Way!</h1>

    <script>
        var tutor = {
            fname: "Krishna",
            lname: "Prasad",
            email: "krishnaprasad@gmail.com",
            city: "California",
            role: "Web Designer",
            mobile: 9948542732
        };

        // This is one method to access object values
        document.write(tutor.fname + "<br>");
        document.write(tutor.lname + "<br>");
        document.write(tutor.email + "<br>");

        // This is another way to access object values
        document.write(tutor.fname + "<br>" + tutor.lname + "<br>" + tutor.email + "<br>" + tutor.role + "<br><br>")

        // This is DESTRUCTURING Method, finest way to access the oject values
        var { fname, lname, email, city, role, mobile } = tutor;

        document.write(
            fname + ", " + lname + ", " + email + ", " + city + ", " + role + ", " + mobile
        );

        // ****************************************************
        // For In Loop

        for (xyz in tutor) {
            console.log(xyz + ":" + tutor[xyz]);
        }
