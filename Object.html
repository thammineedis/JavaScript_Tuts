    <h3>In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A
        cup is
        an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way,
        JavaScript
        objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.</h3>

    <h6>Example:</h6>
    <h4>
        Like here in my Example I can choose a person to declare as an Object. <br>
        Object should be within Curly Braces{}. Properties seperated with Comma(,)
        <pre>
            var objectName = {name:'James', email:'james@gmail.com', designation:'developer', age:32, mob:12345};
        </pre>
    </h4>

    <script>
        var person = { name: 'Matrix', age: 32, gender: 'Male', email: 'matrix@gmail.com', height: 5.11, color: 'fair' };

        person.mobile = 12345; // This method is called as Dot Notaion. We are able to call property this way also.
        person['designation'] = 'Web Developer'; // This method is called as Square Notation. Within Suqare Brackets we can call properties.

        // typeof() is a Builtin keyword to identify Data Type from an Object
        console.log(typeof (person.email)); // Output will show email as a 'string'.

        console.log(person);

    </script>
